Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?

**Planning**

-Start with your database!
-Draw your tables and your schema. How can you connect them? (min. 2 tables)

-Wireframe!

-Divide your tasks into 15-20 min chunks.

-If a task is too abstract or takes longer than 20 mins, can you divide it into smaller tasks?

-If your scope is getting out of hand, check the requirements! The requirements are you MVP.
-Start building the app from the most basic version of it. What are the main building blocks?

**-Main requirements:**
-Routes (static, dynamic).
-Displaying the data from the database.
-Sending data to the database.
