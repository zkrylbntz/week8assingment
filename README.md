What went really well and what could have gone better?

So this week has been a bit all over the place with due to some illness in the family, hence the extension.
I haven't managed to achieve everything that I had set out, but I have had to submit it as is so I do not burn myself out either, as I have been feeling a little run down.
However I am pleased with the achievements I have made.

This week I have acheived all of the requirements apart from the delete button. I was able to get the main pieces in place fairly quickly. I had a form set up, with those reviews going onto a page, and then the titles of those reviews linking to their dynamic pages. I was happy to have implemented the URL submission to an image being displayed.

I came to a slight hurdle with the database, I was still a little bit unsure of the relationships of my tables. I had a discussion with Ashir where he helped me to see that I had a one to many relationship and there was no foreign key table needed, and how to link a one to many relationship. However I couldn't for the life of me work out the DELETE db query for the button.

My second hurdle was with styling, my styling through the other assingments has been slow build up to what I was really happy with (last weeks submission) and I was feeling confident with it for this week, however I feel I left it too late. And at the time I had started I didn't go around it the right way, I kinda left it all to tailwind, and I think it made it harder for myself.
Generally as a whole, that needed planning. I didn't have a clear view with the planning side of things this week. I was using what I could with last weeks assingments but trying to scale it up a bit.

There are some things left out, the About and the Homepage, unfortunatley at the time of reading this I am a bit out-of-steam, and I thought as it was all functional to submit as is and rest where I can. There are some little things missing and not working, for example I couldn't link up the metadata for the dynamic pages, I did what I could with the logic I thought was right but couldn't work it out. And I couldn't figure out the path redirecting for my comment form.

Please could you advise me on the following, sql queries I know we have covered them in different scenarios, but sometimes I find it hard to know what to write. With a Google search I only seem to find examples of what we have used, do you know of a list of things you can query, if that makese sense?

Secondly I have found the passing of props and information to be a slight grey area of mine, I can grasp the basics of it, but my confidence isn't there, sometimes I know what I want but just not 100% sure how to get it.

Also, I came across a couple situations in this assignment where some examples were getting information from API's however the information we were getting was from a database, which I found hard to follow and implement. Have you got any tips or solutions with those kinds of situations? I know it sounds like early stuff we've covered but I sometimes know what I'm doing but don't know what methods apply to different information types.

I think that is all, I will try much harder this week to plan everything, even down to the styling as I don't have anything to show you, apart from my database visuliser. And I will refresh myself with the styling side of things, I really enjoyed it in the workshops and I felt it was doing what I wanted it to do, but when it came to the assingment I had to refresh my memory a lot and so I ended up trying lots of different things and they wouldn't all do what I wanted them too.
